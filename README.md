# Dynamic-Bayesian-SPT-Model

**1:** Reduce the resolution of optical classes, chlorophyll, and Longhurst regions data sets.

**2:** Define the global dominant optical classes, then geographically subdivided in terms of ocean basins. Including plotting of projected optical classes.

**3:** Input dataset setting for dynamic spatiotemporal models.

**4.1:** Fitting model with dynamic optical classes.

**4.2:** Fitting model with static optical classes.

**4.3:** Fitting model with static Longhurst regions.

**5:** Plotting trend estimats and related uncertainties from dynamic models.

**6:** Model comparisons and diagnose result.

**7:** Supporting infomation analysis and visualization
